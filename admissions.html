        <p >"Dear Team SOI, Thank you for the wonderful arrangements during Proud Parents Day. It was incredible just like the smile that you put on everyone's faces. It was nostalgic. Inexpensive games created from everyday stuff, learning how to reuse while celebrating hours of endless fun, filled with strategy & motor skills. it gave us the essence of Indianess. What a lovely heritage and what deep thought-provoking roots. Hoping to see more of our roots being taught to our children and a sense of national pride resurrecting. Nation first always. Jai Hind, Jai Bharat!"

            <p>I've been following School Of India from the day of inception & I got feedback that yes this is the school that aims at the entire personality development of the child. SOI provides an open environment & an ability for my kids to hone & nurture their skills, absolutely a dream come true for me."
